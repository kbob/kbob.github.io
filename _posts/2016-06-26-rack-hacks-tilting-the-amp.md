title: 'Rack Hacks: Tilting the Amp'
---
The amp didn't fit in the mixer rack, so I designed and printed a
spacer to tilt it.  3D printers are *still* awesome.

I have an old mixer, amp, and power conditioner.  I bought a
[rack stand](https://on-stage.com/products/view/11185) a few weeks ago
to hold them.  As many Amazon reviewers said, the stand's bottom rack space is
useless because the rack tilts it into the table.  In my case, the
rear bar also prevented plugging in the amp's power cord.

Since the mixer doesn't use all of its bottom space, I could tilt the
amp up.  The tricky part is making the screws align with the amp and
the rack.  I came up with this.  (Second spacer cut away to show
internal passages)

At the skinny end, a single machine screw goes through both the amp
and the rack.  The smaller block sits in front to make a face parallel
to the screw head.

At the wide end, there are two screws.  One sits in a blind hole and
screws into the rack.  The other goes through the amp and screws into
the spacer.  Since the top of the spacer is in compression, that
screw is under minimal strain, so soft plastic works fine.

There is a passage to get a hex-key wrench onto the inner screw.  It
is tilted up 19Â°, but a ball-end wrench works fine.

The whole rack looks like this.

I printed those red washers at the same time to make the whole
assembly a little more cheery.  And I used M5 screws by mistake.
In this project, I learned that M5 and 10-32 screws are almost
the same size.  Oops.

Now I have an extra space at the top of the rack.  I have a couple of
1U synths; I just need to decide which one I like better.
