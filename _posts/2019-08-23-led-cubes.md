title: LED Cubes &mdash; Mine and Others
---
I made an LED cube.  It is roughly 136mm on a side (5⅜ inches),
and each side is covered by thousands of RGB LEDs.  A computer
and a battery inside control the LEDs and can display graphics
at full video rate.


# Why?

It all started in October, 2018 when [Piotr](https://twitter.com/esden)
sent me a prototype of his new FPGA development board, the
[iCEBreaker](https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga).
He also sent along a handful of interface boards and a 64×64 LED panel.

I took that as a sign I needed to learn Verilog and digital design.  I
haven't gotten very far in the latter, but I did get the LED panel to
light up and do several interesting animations.

A short while later, I saw
[a video clip](https://twitter.com/zzaurak/status/949810395623186432)
of Zzaurak's LED cube.
I immediately wanted one.


# Prior Art

I believe Zzaurak was the first, but several people have built LED cubes.
AFAIK, all of them are in Europe.

Zzaurak and Happy Teddy have made at least three generations of LED cubes,
with 3D printed, machined, and injection molded chassis.  They are
currently working on producing them for sale.  Their cubes have a
Raspberry Pi and a battery pack inside.  The first ones drove the
LEDs directly from the Pi; later ones are using an iCEBreaker,
and Zzaurak is working on new electronics that integrate power supply
and FPGA on a single board.

Polyfloyd, Sebastius and Boekenwuurm each made cubes.  Theirs
have laser cut plywood chassis and connect to external power supplies.
They also use a Raspberry Pi to drive the LEDs directly.
Unfortunately, Sebastius' cube was dropped.  The chassis shattered, and it was
never rebuilt.

[@Ahmet](https://twitter.com/ahmet1UP) made a cube with a laser cut plywood chassis.  I don't know much about it.

[Lars Michelson](https://twitter.com/LarsMichelsen/status/1136698063408549889) also has a cube.  His Twitter feed shows some interesting and unique animations.

[vifino](https://github.com/vifino) does not have a cube that I know of,
but he has been making arrays of LED panels and writing software to drive them
from Raspberry Pi and/or iCEBreaker FPGA.

[tnt](https://github.com/smunaut) wrote the BCM LED driver that all iCE40-based
cubes use.

[George Ioakimedes](https://twitter.com/georgeioak) also does not
have a cube. But he provided invaluable
help to both me and Zzaurak with the design of our cubes' power supplies.

[Esden](https://1bitsquared.com) created the iCEBreaker FPGA and the HUB75
adapter and got me interested in this.  I gave him parts, and he constructed
the second cube in my design.  (There was a short-lived 3rd cube, but
    we did not have enough LED panels to finish it.)

There is also the [PixxlCube](https://duckduckgo.com/?q="pixxlcube").
I don't know much about it.


# Mechanical

Most of these cubes are based on 64 by 64 P2.5 LED panels.  P2.5 means
the LEDs are spaced 2.5mm apart.  So each panel is 160 by 160mm,
plus a little for the thickness of the panels.  The Pixxlcube
appears to be 32 by 32, P5, which would also be 160 by 160mm.
My cube is 64 by 64 P2.  2mm pitch, 128 by 128mm.  My cube is small
enough to easily palm; the others are a little too big.

Zzaurak and HappyTeddy pioneered the use of a hinged lid held down
by magnetic clasps.  I don't know how the wooden-framed cubes open.
Mine uses a simplified hinge and magnets, and it works very well.

My cube's chassis is 3D printed in PLA.  It started out very similar
to HappyTeddy's printed chassis, but the constraints of fitting everything
into half the volume forced a lot of changes.

The four major components in my cube -- battery, Raspberry Pi, power board, and
iCEBreaker FPGA, are on removable carriers.  The first three are spring
loaded -- the plastic deforms to allow removal.  The FPGA board
is held in place by the power board, so it doesn't need a separate spring.
Zzaurak's injection molded cubes also have interior components that
snap in and out.


# Electronics

The LED panels use a HUB75 interface.  Early cubes use
[a board and driver designed by Henner
Zeller](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix)
that allow a Raspberry Pi to drive
HUB75 directly through its GPIO pins.  Unfortunately the Pi has
neither the realtime OS nor the dedicated bus bandwidth to drive
a 30 MHz signal consistently.

Later cubes use an iCEBreaker FPGA board.  The iCEBreaker connects
to the Pi either via USB or SPI.  It stores an entire video frame
on-chip and generates all the HUB75 signals with rock solid
timing.

I thought a cube made of PCBs would be a good Faraday cage, but it
turns out that WiFi and bluetooth work just fine with the
Raspberry Pi inside the cube.

Most of these cubes have an IMU inside to detect and respond to motion.


# Software

tnt created [gateware for driving LED panels from an
iCE40](https://github.com/smunaut/ice40-playground).
tnt also wrote an uncompressed video streaming App called
[stream](https://github.com/smunaut/ice40-playground/tree/master/projects/rgb_panel/sw).

Zzaurak has software called [matrixserver](https://github.com/squarewavedot/matrixserver).  It has a client-server architecture; Clients generate
pixels and write them to a socket.  The server copies the pixels to
the hardware.  Matrixserver does CPU-based rendering.

Zzaurak also uses game controllers to make matrixserver clients interactive.

Polyfloyd created [Shady](https://github.com/polyfloyd/shady)
and [ledcat](https://github.com/polyfloyd/ledcat).
Shady uses OpenGL fragment shaders to paint
the pixels.  Ledcat reads pixels from its standard input and writes
them to a number of LED devices.  He has a small collection of very nice
[shaders](https://github.com/polyfloyd/cube-shaders).

[vifino](https://github.com/vifino) does not have an LED cube, AFAIK,
but he has lots of LED panels.  He has written [SLED, the Satanic LED
controller](https://github.com/shinyblink/sled).
SLED has backends to drive many type of LEDs, and it has more demos
than all the other packages combined.  SLED uses CPU-based rendering,
and AFAIK all of its apps assume LEDs are on a flat plane.  Still,
they generally look good wrapped around a cube.

My own contribution is [Shaderboy](https://github.com/kbob/shaderboy).
Shaderboy is a lot like Shady, but it is also scriptable in python
for apps that don't work as pure fragment shaders.  Shaderboy is
structured as a Python front end, a Python module, and a C library.


# A Diverse Ecosystem

It looks like all the cool kids are making LED cubes.  For some reason,
almost all the cool kids are in Europe.  There are lots of ideas
and lots of experiments.  It's fun even when it isn't blinking.
