title: check-git finds dirty git repositories
---
Do you have hundreds of git repositories on your laptop?  Have you
ever wondered how many useful bits of code you've forgotten to check
in?  `check-git` is here to answer that question.

Here's an example.  I ran `check-git` in a terminal, and it showed
me the repositories in this somewhat fictitious directory.

    $ check-git
    Arduino Sketchbook/libraries/UniWS
       M src/UniWS.cpp

    Blink Eras
      Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.

      stash@{0}: WIP on master: da5589c README: added link for KiCAD graphics tutorial.

    Repositories without Remotes

    Branched Repositories
           kb Laser/Other Lasers/Software/LasaurApp
         laos Laser/Other Lasers/laoslaser/pstoedit

    Clean Repositories:

      Done for Now/DSP-G1/Audio
      Done for Now/Printed Objects/Automatic Transmission/MCAD
      Laser/Other Lasers/laoslaser/AddOns
      Laser/Other Lasers/laoslaser/Documentation
      Laser/Other Lasers/laoslaser/Firmware
      Laser/Other Lasers/laoslaser/Hardware
      Laser/Other Lasers/laoslaser/Software
      Laser/Other Lasers/laoslaser/laoslaser.github.com
      Rostock MAX/git/RAMBo
      Rostock MAX/git/Repetier-Firmware
      Rostock MAX/git/RostockMAX
      Rostock MAX/git/Slic3r
      Workbench

If the output looks familiar, it should.  `check-git` runs `git
status`, parses its output, and collates the results.

In the first repository, `UniWS`, there is one changed file.  The
second, Blink Eras, has three problems: two untracked files, an old
stash, and changes that haven't been pushed upstream.

Next, `check-git` lists repositories that have no remotes.  Those
repositories would be lost if I lost my laptop or its disk.

Then, we see repositories with branches other than `master` checked
out.  Those aren't necessarily errors, but might indicate topics waiting
to be merged.

Finally, there's some good news.  There are fifteen clean
repositories.  They have no changed or untracked files and no stashes.
They have branch `master` checked out, and have had everything pushed
to their remotes.


# Git checked.

check-git is now [on github](https://github.com/kbob/check-git).
Enjoy!


# What a Mess!

So now I know what a mess my laptop is in.

 * 208 repositories
 * 296 untracked files
 * 15 changed files
 * four stashes
 * one detached HEAD
 * 18 repos on branches
 * 39 repos without remotes
 * 56 clean repos

I think I'll go check something in now.
