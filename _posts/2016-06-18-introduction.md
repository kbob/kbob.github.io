Homage to the patron saint of horrid prose made, I declare this 'blog
officially open.

I wanted to write a couple of articles about
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) but I just couldn't see exhuming
[the old site](https://kernelbob.wordpress.com).  So I made a new one.
Maybe later I'll pull the old articles over.

This site is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.io)
and is powered by GitHub's [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) engine.
I used Ben Centra's [Centrarium](https://bencentra.com/centrarium/)
theme, slightly tweaked.

I'll probably be 'blogging about that stack as I get more familiar
with it.
