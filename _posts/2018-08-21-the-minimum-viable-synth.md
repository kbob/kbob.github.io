title: The Minimum Viable Synth
---
The Minimum Viable Synth is four years old today.  It's time to write
it up.

On August 22, 2014, I saw Yes in concert, and they were great.  Geoff
Downes was dug in behind a fort of keyboards in the center of the
stage.  One of the keyboards caught my eye because it was bright
yellow.  I later learned it was a Studiologic Sledge, and that Downes
promotes Studiologic.  That night, the seed of an idea was planted: I
should make a synth.

I should  make a synth because they're fun.   I'd played with  them a
little.  I took  an electronic music elective in college,  where I got
to spend time with an ARP  2600, a wall-o-Moog-modules, and three reel-to-reel
tape recorders.  And there had been  one glorious weekend when my high
school choir  director let me take  his new ARP Odyssey  home.  And in
the '90s I played around with a  couple of Yamaha VL synths and a wind
controller.  I even implemented the waveguide synth algorithm for
fun.

I should make a synth because I can.  I play the piano.  I know enough
music theory to be dangerous.  I know a little about the physics of
musical instruments and digital signal processing.  And I know about
embedded and real-time programming.  And I know a little about
electronics.

So I started looking at what other people had done.  Other people have
done a lot.  It looks like every nerd on the planet has made a synth
or seven.  So I wasn't going to break new ground, but I would
have fun and learn things.

I kind of knew I wanted to make a virtual analog synth.  I like the
analog sound, but I can design code better than circuits.  And I
kind of knew I wanted it to be polyphonic.  I find monophonic keybards
frustrating to play -- I tend to play chords when I improvise.

So I surveyed the field.  I looked at Nord Leads 1 through 4, the
bright yellow Sledge, Access Virus, Blofeld, and probably some others.
I read their manuals and watched too many YouTube videos.  I learned
who Nick Batt is.

In future posts, I will write about the sound engine, the physical
interface, the electronics, and other topics.

Next: Audio Units.
