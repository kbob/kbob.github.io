excerpt: Classic algorithm applied to a 3D printer enclosure

title: Stupid LACK Stack Hack
---
Every nerd and his brother have 3D printers these days, and a stunning
number of us have made an enclosure out of two or more
[IKEA LACK side tables](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/80104268/#/20011408).
It's a rite of passage, like playing a video game for 24 hours
straight or writing your own MP3 player.

I was moving my LACK stack the other day, and I realized there's a
classic freshman computer science algorithm that tells me exactly how
to do that.

So, one defurnished room and tripod mounted camera later...
