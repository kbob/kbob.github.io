Hi.
I'm kbob.
I'm a software engineer living in beautiful Eugene, Oregon, USA.
Most of my career has been writing Linux and Unix system-level and
networking code, but I've made some side excursions into graphics,
scientific visualization, acoustic simulation, and other odd corners.

And that's just what they paid me for.  On my own time, I
play with microcontrollers,
learn new languages,
build synthesizers,
write CNC firmware,
maintain 3D printers and pinball tables,
ride motorcycles,
fix cars.

I'm active at [Eugene Maker Space](http://www.eugenemakerspace.com).

Neither my wife nor my dog want to be featured in this 'blog.
